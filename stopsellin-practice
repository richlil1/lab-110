*** Pre Security pathway ***



OFFENSIVE SECURITY (red teams)
aims to identify and exploit system vulnerabilities to enhance security measures
  Red teams and penetration testers specialize in these offensive techniques.

using command-line application "Gobuster" to find hidden directories and pages

gobuster -u http://fakebank.thm -w wordlist.txt dir
-u is used to state the website we are scanning
-w takes a list of words to iterate through to find hidden pages
Gobuster scans website with each word in list, tells pages in list of page/directory names




DEFENSIVE SECURITY (blue teams)
exploiting software bugs, leveraging insecure setups, and taking advantage of unenforced access control policies, 
    & preventing intrusions from occuring , detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly 
      User cyber security awareness: Training users about cyber security helps protect against attacks targeting their systems
        Documenting and managing assets: We need to know the systems and devices we must manage and protect adequately
          Updating and patching systems: Ensuring that computers, servers, and network devices are correctly updated and patched against any known vulnerability 
        Setting up preventative security devices: firewall and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are critical components of preventative security. 
        Firewalls control what network traffic can go inside and what can leave the system or network. IPS blocks any network traffic that matches present rules and attack signatures.
      Setting up logging and monitoring devices: Proper network logging and monitoring are essential for detecting malicious activities and intrusions. 
      If a new unauthorized device appears on our network, we should be able to detect it
